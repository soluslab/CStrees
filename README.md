# CStrees

A package for learning an optimal CStree representative of the context-specific causal structure of a data-generating distribution given either observational and/or (general) interventional data. 

The file CStrees.R contains code for constructing and learning CStrees and interventional CStrees from data via optimizing penalized maximum likelihood estimates, such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).  The file mice.R contains an example of these functions applied to a mice protein expression data set available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  Additional examples are included directly in the CStrees file.
